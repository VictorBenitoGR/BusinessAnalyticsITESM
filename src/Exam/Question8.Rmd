- **Use the "mpg" dataset to recreate the following graph and include an interpretation for it regarding: which type of drive train has the best performance in terms of gasoline consumption? what does the trend line mean?**

- **The title of the graph must have your name to be eligible for grading.**

- **Axis and labels: 3 points**

- **Transparency: 1 point**

- **Trend line with confidence interval: 4 points**

- **Interpretation for the two questions: 4 points (it has to be inside the html)**

- **Scatter plot with colors: 6 points**

## <span style="color:#003366">**Plot:**</span>

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot by Victor Benito Garcia Rocha",
    x = "Engine displacement, in litres",
    y = "highway miles per gallon"
  ) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme( # If I don't put this, they appear too black in the html
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "grey")
  )
```

## <span style="color:#003366">**Interpretation:**</span>

- It seems to imply that there is a trade-off between engine size (dipl) and fuel efficiency on highways (hwy). If you get one with higger displ you should consider to be less fuel-efficient, regardless of the drive type (dry).
